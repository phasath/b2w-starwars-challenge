## Why?
This is a job interview challenge. B2W people are very into Star Wars. So they created a challenge about it!
## Requirements
A REST API should be created to serve the Name, Wheather and Surface of each Planet from Star Wars.
It's also desirable to know how many movies did that planet appeared.
This information is in the StarWars Public API: https://swapi.co/.
It's also required a CRUD: add planet, list planets, search by name, search by id and remove planets.
## What have I done
As per my choice, I'm using Python, Flask and MongoDB to create this API.
The source code will be available at [github](https://github.com/phasath/b2w-starwars-challenge) and
it'll be online in [heroku](https://b2w-starwars-challenge.herokuapp.com/).
